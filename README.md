# sarcasm-detector

# The goal of this project was to see if it was possible to build a logistic regression model to detect sarcasm in tweets without manually labeling training data. This goal was accomplished by using hashtags as labels for the data (for example "#sarcasm" to label a sarcastic tweet). Data was scraped from twitter, tokenized, and fed into a logistic regression model. Durring tokenization, hashtags were removed to make the task non-trivial.
