# sarcasm-detector

# The goal of this project was to see if it was possible to build a logistic regression model to detect sarcasm in tweets without manually labeling training data.
# This goal was accomplished by using hashtags as labels for the data.
# Data was scraped from twitter, tokenized, and fed into a logistic regression model.
