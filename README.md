# sarcasm-detector

The goal of this project was to see if it was possible to build a logistic regression model to detect sarcasm in tweets without manually labeling training data. This goal was accomplished by using hashtags as labels for the data (for example "#sarcasm" to label a sarcastic tweet). Data was scraped from twitter, tokenized, and fed into a logistic regression model. During tokenization, hashtags were removed to make the task non-trivial. The model performed well, achieving 69% accuracy and 89% recall. In the future, more text pre-processing and a greater variety of hashtag labels would most likely increase performance.
